# Predicting In-Hospital Mortality Among Patients Admitted with a Diagnosis of Heart Failure: A Machine Learning Approach

Here we include the pipeline for training, testing and validating machine learning models to predict mortality at least 12 hours before event in patients admitted with a heart failure diagnosis. If you would like further details, see the paper below; if you use the code, please cite it.
